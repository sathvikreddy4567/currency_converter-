# currency_converter-
I made a project using python about currency exchange system 
in this project i made a function name currency_converter this function will convert the currency from one type to another type 
i checked the user that user entered correct type or not if user enter incorrect type currency it shows error to the user 
in this i created a that from currency will always converted to ind currency because it is to convert and easy to write the code there are many ways but i choose this 
because this is simple and easy to understand to every one  
After this i made a code that taking the inputs from the user ig:amount, from_currency , to _currency 
this inputs runs in  the function "currency_converter" itgives the result i made a variable name result that result value stores in that variable 
then i made a code to print the result to the user if user enter invalid details it shows some message 
This was the project i made by using python !
